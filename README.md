Interactive Stock Trend Tracker is a Django‑based web app for visualizing recent stock prices. It provides a JSON API and a responsive Bootstrap + Chart.js dashboard with an auto‑updating line chart and table. Users can quickly switch between tickers (e.g. AAPL, GOOGL) to compare stocks in real time.
